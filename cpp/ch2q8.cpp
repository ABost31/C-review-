/*Total Purchase
A customer in a store is purchasing five items. The prices of the five items are
Price of item 1 = $15.95
Price of item 2 = $24.95
Price of item 3 = $6.95
Price of item 4 = $12.95
Price of item 5 = $3.95
Write a program that holds the prices of the five items in five variables. Display each
itemâ€™s price, the subtotal of the sale, the amount of sales tax, and the total. Assume the
sales tax is 7%.*/
